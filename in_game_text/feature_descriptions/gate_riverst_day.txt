The wrought-iron gate creaks slightly as you push it open, revealing a scene that sends shivers down your spine.

The courtyard is cloaked in an unnatural twilight, the feeble light barely penetrating the thick mist that hangs in the air. The 
ground, cracked and overgrown with twisted weeds, crunches beneath your hesitant steps. In the center of the courtyard, a dilapidated 
table stands, adorned only by a solitary piece of stale bread and an empty mug.

As you peer further into the gloom, the architecture of the surrounding buildings leans ominously, their facades twisted like the gnarled 
limbs of some malevolent entity. Shadows dance along the walls, their movements not quite aligning with the feeble breeze that whispers 
through the desolate space.

Even though you can't see anybody, you strongly believe that you are not alone. Unseen eyes seem to watch your every move, and the weight of the unknown presses down upon you.
