- Excuse me, sir. I'm searching for someone, a friend named Alex. Have you seen him around?
Old man's weary eyes flicker with a hint of recognition, but he remains guarded.
- Names are just whispers in the wind here, lost in the echoes of forgotten tales. Alex, you say? Names change, fates intertwine
-  Please, any information could help. We were together since the early childhood, I know he knows how to get himself in trouble,
but, at least, I deserve to know the truth.
Old man's expression softens for a moment, a fleeting spark of empathy breaking through the melancholy
- Friends disappear like shadows in this town. Some willingly, some swallowed by the secrets. Your Alex might be lost to both.
- What secrets? What's happening in Insmouth?
- Some tales are better left untold, and Insmouth harbors more than its fair share. The currents run deep, and those who pry too 
much may find themselves ensnared in the web, where too much resistance will only result in quicker end. 
- I don't care about tales; I care about finding my friend. Tell me, old man!
Old man, unmoved, shakes his head with a melancholic smile
- Save your breath, seeker. Your friend is lost, and Insmouth doesn't yield its prisoners. Go back to the world of the ignorant!
You better leave soon, or you will also end up lost here.
