As you scan the faces of scarce inhabitans of the Insmouth plaza, sunlight casts an eerie glow on their faces, revealing subtle 
abnormalities like unblinking, luminescent eyes . Their features, though human, bear an uncanny resemblance to aquatic beings, 
with hints of webbed fingers and a subtle scaling along their skin. The townspeople move with a strange unity, almost as if attuned 
to some unseen current. Faces etched with the weariness of unspoken knowledge exchange wary glances. Whenever you get too close to 
them, they stop their conversations and attempt to avoid you as much as possible without disrupting their routines.
