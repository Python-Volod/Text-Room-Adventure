The old man eyes the bottle of moonshine with a mixture of curiosity and resignation. He takes it from you, inspecting the makeshift gift. 
His gaze lingers on the aged label, perhaps triggering memories long buried.

Old Man: (Muttering) A bottle to drown the sorrows... or amplify them.

He uncorks the bottle and takes a cautious sip, his features softening for a moment as the liquid burns down his throat. The weight of the 
town's despair seems to lift, if only momentarily.

Raymond: Forgetfulness is a rare luxury here. The town feasts on memories, but for a brief moment, I appreciate the reprieve. People used to 
call me Raymond back in the days.

You notice a subtle shift in his demeanor, a crack in the facade. The burden of ages seems to momentarily fade, and his words carry a touch more 
sincerity.

Raymond: Your friend, Alex, if still alive is caught in the same web we all are. The threads of fate in Insmouth are tangled and unforgiving.
But, if he choose to stay at that damned hotel, the chance of you ever seying him again are slim.

He leans closer, his words now a hushed confession, as if sharing forbidden knowledge.

Raymond: (Whispering) The reef, that jagged maw on the horizon, hides more than the eye can fathom. Shadows move on its surface, figures that 
defy the natural order. Human-like, yet beyond our kin.

His gaze remains fixed on the distant Devil's Reef, and a shiver passes through him.

Raymond: (Tensely) Beware, seeker. Venture not into the abyss of the reef; it harbors secrets darker than the abyss itself. Better even, forget 
and move on while you can.

With that, Raymond withdraws, his defenses rising once more, leaving you with the weight of revelations in the shadowed courtyard.
