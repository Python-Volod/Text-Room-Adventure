You stand outside the decrepit Innsmouth house, a grotesque structure that reeks of dampness and decay. As you peer through the window, 
you catch a glimpse of the dinner scene unfolding within.

The room is dimly lit by flickering candles, casting eerie shadows on the worn, wooden furniture. The dinner table is laden with curious 
dishes – strange, indescribable seafood, with an otherworldly aroma that assaults your senses. The Insmouth locals sit in silence, their 
eyes fixed on their plates, their movements mechanical and synchronized.

As you watch, a disturbing realization creeps over you – the faces of the townsfolk are gaunt and fish-like, their eyes vacant and lifeless. 
They chew mechanically on the unidentifiable sea creatures, producing unsettling, squelching sounds that echo through the room. The air is 
thick with an oppressive stillness, broken only by the occasional gasp or muffled sob.

You can feel an unnatural compulsion, a force trying to draw you into this macabre feast. The longer you observe, the more the sense of dread 
intensifies, gnawing at the edges of your sanity. The once distant whispers of the abyss now echo in your mind, urging you to join the unnerving communion.

You jump away from the window in dread.
