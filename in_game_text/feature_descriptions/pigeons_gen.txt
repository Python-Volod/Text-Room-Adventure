As you approach the central plaza's edge, a flock of pigeons gathers near a scattering of crumbs left behind by some unseen hand. 
Their iridescent feathers shimmer in the dappled sunlight, and their cooing creates a haunting melody in the air. Upon closer inspection, 
you notice peculiar markings on a few of the pigeons, almost as if someone has purposefully adorned them with small, cryptic symbols.
