In the lobby of the Gilman Hotel, your gaze is drawn to a peculiar portrait that hangs on the wall. The figure within wears an enigmatic smile, 
and their eyes seem to follow your every move. The artist's brushstrokes create an uncanny aura, as if the subject is both watching and being 
watched. In the corner, you notice the name "Charlie Gilman" inscribedâ€” probably hotel's founder, you think. 
The once-vivid colors have mellowed with age.
