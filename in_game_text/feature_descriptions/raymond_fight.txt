- Look, old man, I don't have time for your cryptic nonsense. Tell me about Alex, now!
Old man narrows his eyes, his weariness replaced by a spark of defiance.

- You tread on thin ice, outsider. Insmouth doesn't take kindly to demands.
- I'm not here to dance around your riddles. Where is Alex?
Old man's demeanor shifts from weariness to outright hostility.

- You're playing with forces beyond your understanding. Walk away before you become another nameless whisper in the shadows.
- I won't leave without answers.
Old man clenches his fists, and the air thickens with tension.

- Ignorance is bliss, and your curiosity will be your undoing.
