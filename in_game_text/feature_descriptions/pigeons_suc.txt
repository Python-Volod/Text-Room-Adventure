Curiosity piqued, you decide to interact with the pigeons. As you approach you throw crumbles of bread to distract pigeons, some 
scatter while others remain, eyeing you with an odd intelligence. Among the group, you spot a pigeon with an intricately folded note 
attached to its leg, secured by a delicate ribbon. It appears as though these pigeons are carriers of hidden messages, perhaps a 
clandestine method of communication within the peculiar social fabric of Insmouth.
