You attempt to start a conversation - Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for my friend. He was last seen in Insmouth a few weeks ago. Tall, dark hair, goes by the name of Alex
(Concierge Studies you with a guarded expression) - Insmouth tends to keep its secrets well, friend. People come and go, and not all find what they seek
- Well, he wouldn't just dissaper with no trace. Sir, you must understand, I've got to find him. Any idea where he might have gone around here?
- (Leaning on the counter, tapping a finger) This town is a labyrinth of memories and shadows. We don't like strangers arround here, but if you ask me you might want to start at the docks.
- Thanks. I'll start there. Any other advice?
- Watch your steps. Some roads lead to places better left unexplored. And, remember, not everything lost wants to be found.
- Noted. I appreciate the guidance. If you see or hear anything about Alex, please let me know.
- Surelly, I'll keep an eye and an ear out. Be careful.
