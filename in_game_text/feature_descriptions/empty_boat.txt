As you approach the docks in Insmouth, your attention is drawn to a solitary, empty boat gently swaying in the water. Tied securely 
to the dock, it shows signs of neglect—weathered wood, faded paint, and a layer of accumulated grime. Peering inside, you notice a
few abandoned fishing implements scattered across the floor—an old tackle box, a worn-out net, and a rusted bait bucket. The musty 
odor of seawater and decay emanates from the vessel, telling a silent tale of days gone by.
