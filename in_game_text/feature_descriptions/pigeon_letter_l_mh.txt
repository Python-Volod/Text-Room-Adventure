Upon removing the note with shaking hands, you unfold it to reveal a cryptic message, written in an archaic script that, to your own
surprise and dread, you can understand:

Esteemed Brethren,

In the shadows of our blessed town, where eldritch secrets fester like sores upon the fabric of reality, I pen this missive of dread. 
As the moon will ascend in fortnight, its baleful glow reveals an impending benevolenceâ€”a ritual unspeakable, slated for the unhallowed 
grounds of Devil's Reef, where the ancient one lies dormant beneath the waves, waiting with malevolent patience.

A clammy unease pervades the air, thick with the stench of brine, as if the very atmosphere recoils from the impending malevolence. 
Murmurs, not of this mortal realm, emanate from the insidious stones beneath our feet. The ritual must unfurl, finally making our youth 
join us under the waves

Prepare, for the abyss yearns for thy presence, and the culmination of the ritual shall etch its insidious resonance upon the annals of Insmouth's 
accursed history.

Yours in the spectral throes of anticipation,

Elijah, Custodian of the Esoteric Order of Dagon
