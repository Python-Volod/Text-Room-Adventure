As you leap across the gaps between rusted railcars, the distant echoes of pursuit fade away. The rhythmic clatter of your hurried 
steps becomes a desperate symphony, signaling your escape from the clutches of Insmouth. The moonlight guides your path along the 
desolate railway, casting eerie shadows that mark the periphery of your newfound freedom. Ahead lies the journey to Arkham, leaving 
the nightmarish town of Insmouth behind, a place where secrets and shadows intertwine, and only the resilient can emerge unscathed 
from the haunting echoes of the abandoned tracks.
