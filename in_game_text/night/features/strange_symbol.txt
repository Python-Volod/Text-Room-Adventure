To your own surprise, you can undestand the text: 
Thy who is worthy, thy who has survived unseen horrors, thy who has something to pay, can become a champion of humankind, 
the one and only Doom Slayer - the only human to instill dread and fear into the black hearts of Daemons. 
Insert a coin, and scream the password known only to the heart of black and silver.
