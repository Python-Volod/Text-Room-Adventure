As you drift into a fitful slumber, the oppressive silence of the night is shattered by the unmistakable creaks and murmurs of malevolent 
intent echoing from the floor below. You approach your door in an attempt to overhear what is happening bellow. You hear the following:

Concierge - "What are you waiting for, he is there sleeping. As promised, this one is yours to kill"

You stager away from the door.A chill courses through your veins, awakening you to a sense of imminent danger.

Instinctively, you glance towards the window, realizing the futility of an escape through the sheer drop below. Swiftly assessing your 
options, your eyes settle on the writing desk – a makeshift barricade to fortify the feeble door against whatever malevolent force lurks 
outside.

With determined haste, you push the desk against the door, its uneven legs scraping against the aged floor. The room becomes a sanctuary, 
albeit temporary, against the impending threat. Fear and urgency guide your actions as you ponder the next move.

Surveying the room, your gaze falls upon the adjacent corner. A spark of realization ignites as you recognize the potential escape route – 
the adjoining room with its window overlooking the neighboring rooftop.
