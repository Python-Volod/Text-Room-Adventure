As the evening descends upon Insmouth, you find yourself standing before the dilapidated inn, wearied by the fruitless exploration of the city's 
mysterious corners. The inn's entrance beckons, and you decide to seek shelter within.

Upon entering, you notice the concierge—an enigmatic figure with guarded eyes—glancing up from behind the counter. Weariness etches itself on 
your face as you approach him.

With a nod of acknowledgment, you initiate the conversation, "I'm new in town and could use a room for the night. Any available?"

The concierge, leaning on the counter with a predatory gaze, suggests a deeper awareness beneath the surface - "Rooms for the night are available. 
Coin for comfort, as they say."

Acknowledging the peculiar circumstances of Insmouth, you decide to take a room, "I'll take a room then. Anything I should know before I retire for 
the night?"

Tapping a finger on the counter, the concierge imparts cryptic advice - "Remember, the night in Insmouth is not always silent. It has its own language, 
and not all sounds are friendly. Watch your steps, stranger."

Thanking him, your mind preoccupied with thoughts of the city and its mysteries, you express your gratitude - "If you happen to hear or see anything unusual, 
please inform me. I'm still finding my way around this place."

The concierge, with a subtle smirk, replies, "Curiosity can be a double-edged sword. I'll keep an eye and an ear out."

As the concierge turns to retrieve a key, he heads toward a door behind the counter. Suspiciously, he opens it just enough to slip inside, blocking your sight. 
A strange, rotting stench emanates from the room. Shortly, he returns with another key in hand - "Your key, sir! The only available room we have is on the third 
floor, 310B."

As you contemplate the mysterious backroom, the concierge, as if sensing your unspoken question, adds, "Nothing of interest, rest well! Let me show you the way up 
to your room."

You, realizing the concierge might hold valuable information, decide to press further, "By the way, I'm looking for a friend. He was last seen in Insmouth —tall, 
dark hair, goes by the name of Alex. Any chance you've heard or seen anything?"

The concierge, maintaining his guarded demeanor, studies you for a moment before responding, "Insmouth tends to keep its secrets well, friend. People come and 
go, and not all find what they seek."

Persisting in your inquiry, you stress the urgency, "Well, he wouldn't just disappear without a trace. Sir, you must understand, I've got to find him. Any idea 
where he might have gone around here?"

Leaning on the counter, the concierge taps a finger thoughtfully, "This town is a labyrinth of memories and shadows. We don't like strangers around here, but if you ask me, 
I haven't seen anybody like that."
