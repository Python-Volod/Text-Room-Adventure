As the evening descends upon Insmouth, you return to the dilapidated inn, wearied by the fruitless exploration of the city's mysterious corners. 
The concierge, an enigmatic figure with guarded eyes, glances up as you approach the counter once again.

You initiate the conversation, weariness etched on your face - "I've scoured the city, sir, and found no trace of my friend. I need a place to
rest for the night. Any chance I could rent a room?"

The concierge, leaning on the counter, studies you with a hint of curiosity. His gaze, like a predatory cat, suggests a deeper awareness beneath 
the surface - "Rooms for the night are available. Coin for comfort, as they say."

You nod, acknowledging the peculiar circumstances of Insmouth. "I'll take a room then. Anything else I should know before I retire for the night?"

The concierge, tapping a finger on the counter, imparts cryptic advice - "Remember, the night in Insmouth is not always silent. It has its own 
language, and not all sounds are friendly. Watch your steps, stranger."

You thank him, your mind preoccupied with thoughts of your missing friend and the strangness of this city. "If you hear or see anything, especially 
about Alex, please inform me. I can't rest until I find him."

The concierge, with a subtle smirk, replies, "Rest is a fleeting luxury in these parts. I'll keep my senses sharp, but not all truths are gentle."

Concierge turns arround grabing a key connected to the back of his trousers, and procedes to the door behind the counter. Suspiciously, he opens it 
just enough to slip inside, blocking your sight. A strange, rotting stench emanates from the room. 

Shortly, he returns with another key in his hand. - "Your key, sir! The only available room we have is on the third floor 310B"

As you were about to ask what is inside that backroom, the concierge as if sensing your question says - "Nothing of interest, rest well! Let, me show the
way up to your room."
