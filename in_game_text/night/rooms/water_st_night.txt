As you tread the desolate Water Street under the cloak of night, a chilling quitness replaces the daytime bustle of the Docks. The 
cobblestone path, now veiled in shadows, guides you alongside the silent structures of Insmouth. To your left, the aged buildings, 
once familiar, take on a more foreboding aspect as their timeworn shutters seem to conceal any movement in the darkness.

Venturing forward, through a break in the dilapidated structures the vast bay unveils itself as a mysterious expanse. In the dim 
moonlight, the waters barely reflect the imposing figure of the strange reef, now a haunting silhouette against the night sky.
