As you tread the cobblestones of Insmouth's River Street under the moon's feeble glow, the atmosphere undergoes a chilling transformation. 
The buildings, once merely leaning, now loom like silent sentinels in the night, casting disconcerting shadows that dance with malevolent intent.
Storefronts, now swallowed in darkness, stand as relics of a thriving past, their peeling paint echoing the town's inevitable descent into obscurity.

The whispers, once faint, now rise like phantoms, weaving an unsettling tapestry of murmurs that seem to emanate from the very cobblestones 
beneath your feet. The river, once a rhythmic dance, becomes an eerie symphony, each lap against the docks a haunting note in the nocturnal 
enigma that envelops River Street.

You notice a group of three small people looking like teenagers roaming this street.
