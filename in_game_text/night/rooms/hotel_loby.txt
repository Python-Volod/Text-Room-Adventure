As you step into the Gilman Hotel lobby, a hushed stillness blankets the air, broken only by the distant creaks of ancient floorboards.
The dim lighting casts long shadows, revealing faded wallpaper peeling at the edges, bearing witness to the passage of countless years. 
Dust particles dance in the filtered light, suspended in an almost spectral choreography. The worn carpet, once rich and vibrant, now 
lies faded and threadbare beneath your footsteps, muffling any sound that might disturb the quiet of the space. The reception desk, 
weathered and aged, stands as a sentinel to the hotel's history, its surface adorned with arcane symbols that hint at the mysteries 
concealed within the walls. A solitary point of your interest located behind it, the backdoor.
