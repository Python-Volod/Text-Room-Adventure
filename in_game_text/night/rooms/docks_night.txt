Night falls, casting the Insmouth fisherman dock into a realm of harrowing shadows. Moonlight reveals the piers' secrets and worn vessels, 
standing as silent witnesses to maritime struggles. Algae-covered planks bear witness to eldritch legacies.Under the moon's pallid glow, 
the once calm waters now conceal the lurking horror. Unseen creatures splash and writhe, their movements echoing the ominous depths. In the 
darkness, figures emergeâ€”unnatural and otherworldly. These nocturnal scavengers, their intentions veiled, roam in great numbers.

You realize that comming here was a terrible mistake, but probably it is too late.
