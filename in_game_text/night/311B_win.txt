You kick open the door to room 311B. Inside, you spot a window and a worn-out desk.
As the door swings open, you hear loud footsteps of a croud comming up the stairs.


You make a quick decision to barricade the door. The desk, heavy and solid, seems your best bet. You drag it over and shove it against 
the door, creating a makeshift barrier.

The pursuing sounds grow louder, urging you to move faster. As the desk scrapes across the floor, you know your next move is crucial 
in this nighttime fight for survival. So you sprint towards the window and attempt to hop to the adjacent roof.
