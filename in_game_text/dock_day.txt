As you step onto the Insmouth fisherman dock in the daylight, the scene unfolds with an eerie calmness. The aged wooden piers stretch 
into the tidal waters, their surfaces worn by years of relentless sea spray and the secrets whispered by the waves. Fishing vessels, 
weathered and patched, gently sway in the currents, revealing tales of maritime struggle etched into their very hulls. The cries of 
seagulls echo in the air, mingling with the rhythmic creaking of moorings, creating a haunting soundtrack to the daily rituals of 
the fishermen. Faces weathered by the elements focus on the meticulous tasks of net mending and boat preparation, each action an 
unspoken acknowledgment of the mysterious depths they navigate. Shadows play upon the algae-covered planks, bearing witness to the 
eldritch legacy embedded in the dock's timeworn structure. Amid the appearance of mundane maritime routines, a subtle tension lingers, 
exchanged through wary glances and unspoken understanding among the seasoned fishermen, hinting at the obscure and uncanny 
facets of Insmouth's maritime traditions
