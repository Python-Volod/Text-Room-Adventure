Looking down at Insmouth from this hill feels like staring into a town that time forgot. The buildings down there, worn-out and beaten by years of 
weather and neglect definetly can tell stories you might not want to hear. Cobblestone streets wind through the place, giving off this eerie vibe.
Dim streetlights flicker every now and then, casting long shadows that play tricks on your eyes. The sea breeze brings vile smell of roting fish 
and a thick fog, wrapping everything in a mysterious cloak. The old buildings, once proud, now stand as silent witnesses to history. 
From up here, Insmouth feels like a place frozen in time, where the ghosts of the past linger in the peeling paint and the crooked, cobblestone streets.
It's a town that you would normally try to avoid at all costs, but at this moment your old friend might be at dire need of your help.
