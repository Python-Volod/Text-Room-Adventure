As you venture towards the outskirts of Insmouth, a desolate expanse unfolds, revealing the skeletal remnants of an abandoned rail. 
The tracks, once conduits of industry, now lie rusted and forgotten, ensnared by encroaching weeds and shadows.

The air carries a heavy stillness, broken only by the mournful creaking of dilapidated railcars that stand as silent sentinels to a 
bygone era. The structures, now mere husks of their former utility, bear witness to the inexorable advance of time.

The silence is pervasive, interrupted occasionally by the haunting whispers of wind through the skeletal frames. Sunlight flickers 
through the gnarled branches, casting elongated shadows across the forsaken railway. An eerie beauty underscores the decay, as nature 
reclaims what industry abandoned.
