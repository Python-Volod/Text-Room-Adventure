As you enter the Water Street, the salty tang of the sea hangs heavy in the air. The cobblestone path beneath your feet, weathered 
by time and tides, lead you alongside the bustling Docks. To your left, the quaint facades of aged buildings stand sentinel, their 
timeworn shutters creaking in the ocean breeze.

A curious sight unfolds as you pass forward. Through a break in the dilapidated structures, the vast bay stretches before 
you. The waters shimmer in the dappled sunlight, revealing an imposing figure in the distance - a strange reef.
