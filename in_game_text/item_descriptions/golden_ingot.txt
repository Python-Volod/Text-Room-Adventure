Before you lies a mesmerizing golden ingot, seemingly ordinary in its metallic splendor yet evoking an uncanny allure. 
The metal appears to possess a unique sheen, as if infused with an ethereal essence that defies the common characteristics of earthly alloys.
Delicate patterns, reminiscent of ocean waves and mysterious symbols are carved in its surface, hinting at an artisanal craftsmanship beyond 
the realms of conventional metallurgy. As you turn the ingot arround, you notice a set of four digits "⇂ᄅᄅㄣ" roughly carved on its back, 
clearly with the help of a knife.
