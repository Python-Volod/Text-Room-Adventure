As you step into Insmouth's central plaza, a haunting atmosphere envelops you. The cobblestone paths, worn and weathered, echo with 
the whispers of ages past. Surrounding buildings, with their timeworn facades, loom overhead, casting shadows that seem to dance with 
eldritch secrets. A stagnant fountain stands in the center, its waters eerily still, reflecting the faded grandeur of a town steeped 
in mystery. Sparse gatherings of locals exchange hushed conversations, their wary glances suggesting an unspoken understanding of the 
peculiarities that define Insmouth. The air is thick with the scent of saltwater and the unspoken pact to keep the town's enigmatic 
past shrouded in silence.
