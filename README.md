# Text-Room-Adventure
This is my attempt at game development inspired by reading the shadow over Innsmouth. My apologies for the mess in the
composition of in-game text files and visual assistance. Feel free to play or contribute; I plan to expand the
game by adding GUI, improving files structure, and by improving plot and graphics very soon. Enjoy!
